          I'm joking! I'm Bryan, a
          <b class="bold">Junior UX designer </b>based in
          <b class="bold">Italy</b> 🍕. Ever since I was a kid, I have always
          loved <b class="bold">IT</b> and <b class="bold">design</b>.

          <br />
          I believe that in IT there always is a
          <b class="bold">solution</b>. And I live my life with this attitude:
          is there a problem? I <b class="bold">analyze</b> it, go to
          stakoverflow and ... Oh NONO! I fix it. <br />
          There is inherent <b class="bold">problem-solving</b> in my being.
          <br />
          My education? That's a bit <b class="bold">strange</b>. Since I was 9
          years old, I have constantly tried to make something out of my first
          <b class="bold">PC</b> - my dream was to become an "IT technician".
          <br />
          <br />
          A dream instantly interrupted by the choice of the middle-school. I
          decided in fact to study accounting. I undertook this journey both for
          my analytical and problem-solving skills, and for my parents
          suggestions. <br />
          After 5 years (6 to be honest) I've graduated in accounting and I
          started to work in the tourism field as a receptionist. Two years
          later, I was a hotel receptionist, an accountant, an IT assistant, and
          in my free-time I was studying Economics at the University. <br />
          <br />
          During the Covid-19 pandemic, I have become aware that the life I was
          living did not really belong to me. Furthermore I realized that I was
          living the nightmare of my teen ages. <br />
          <br />

          All of a sudden, my dream, the one I had since I was a kid, got back
          in my life. I started to surf in the net and I discovered an
          impressive amount of brand-new innovative careers. And among the many
          possibilities, one jumped out at me - the Start2impact
          <a

            target="_blank"
          >
            online course</a
          >. And here I am today, with a professional profile in the Ux design
          field. From day one I have loved this stunning <i>new </i> world. A
          world that fits my being, ever since I was young. <br />
          <br />
          And yes, I am finally ready to live my dream job <i>with you</i>.
